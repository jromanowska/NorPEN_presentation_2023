## Methods {.center}

. . .

`r fa("prescription-bottle-medical")` Norwegian Prescription Database

. . .

`r fa("magnifying-glass")` hypothesis-free screening    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(Cox regression)_

. . .

`r fa("pills")` ATC-code level 2    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(C09 = agents acting on renin-angiotensin system)_

. . .

`r fa("star-of-life")` additional analyses:    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_sex-stratified_    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_time-lag_    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_dose-response_

::: notes
- NorPD: entire dataset, more than 600 million prescriptions from ca.4.5 million
Norwegians, in the period 2004-2019
- Cox regression with time-dependent exposure and age as time scale, adjusted for
sex and education (as a proxy for socio-economic status); also: sex-stratified
analysis
- grouping the drugs

We have conducted several sensitivity analyses, most importantly:

- _time-lag analyses_, where the exposure period was shortened for everyone by
3, 5, 8, or 10 years
- _dose-response analyses_, where the exposure was modeled as a categorical
variable with quartiles of the number of prescriptions taken

### 10 drug classes `r fa("arrow-down")` PD-risk, 21 drug classes `r fa("arrow-up")` PD-risk

::: notes
Here, I'm schematically showing majority of the significant results.

The Hazard-ratios (HR) ranged from 0.68 to 1.94 for the pooled analysis.

## Drug classes retaining the effect throughout time and doses

::: notes
- drug classes `r fa("arrow-up")` PD-risk:
  - help identify patients early
  - _e.g., urologicals, psychoanaleptics_
  - Long way to go - all the RCTs have so far failed, but one problem might be
that patients involved in these had too advanced stage of PD for the drug
to be able to reverse the brain damage.


- drug classes `r fa("arrow-down")` PD-risk
  - might be repurposed as new treatment
  - _e.g., drugs acting on renin-angitensin system, drugs for obstructive lung disease_
